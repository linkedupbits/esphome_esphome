# This implements the tft_espi library 
this is based off work initially performed by @clowrey https://github.com/clowrey/tft_espi-esphome/blob/main/components/tdisplays3   
However this is being implemented to avoid the use of the Display Component, as it needs a RAM buffer which constrains use on devices with low memory and large screens.
